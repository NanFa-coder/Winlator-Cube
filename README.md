很简单 就是Winlator中测试渲染的小魔方

在虚空中，一个几何之灵悄然苏醒——一个完美无瑕的立方体，正以优雅的韵律缓缓旋转。其六面均覆以微软的传奇色谱：深邃的蓝如浩渺苍穹，炽烈的红似熔岩奔涌，生机之绿若初春新叶，明艳之黄胜破晓晨光，每一面色彩在运动中流淌，交织成一首无声的视觉交响。

随着时间之河悄然流淌，立方体绕中心轴起舞，先是沿Y轴轻旋，湛蓝的面庞掠过视野，投下流转变幻的光影，宛如星河倾泻。继而，旋转蔓延至红与绿的棱角，二者在三维空间中追逐嬉戏，红如火焰腾跃，绿似藤蔓舒展，在旋转矩阵的精密调度下，色彩边界模糊又重生，仿佛空间本身在呼吸。

角度随每一帧光阴微妙偏移，立方体化为动态的丰碑——蓝面隐入暗影时，黄面便绽出辉煌；红与绿交融的刹那，诞生了短暂的紫罗兰梦境。这旋转非机械的重复，而是色彩在四维时空中的哲学漫步，每一次转动都重塑光的叙事，将微软之魂凝固为永恒的运动诗篇。

In the void, a geometric spirit quietly woke up - a flawless cube, slowly rotating with an elegant rhythm. Its six sides are covered with Microsoft's legendary chromatography: the deep blue is like the vast sky, the blazing red is like lava rushing, the green of vitality is like the new leaves in early spring, and the bright yellow is better than the morning light. Each color flows in the movement, intertwined into a silent visual symphony.

As the river of time flows quietly, the cube dances around the central axis. First, it spins gently along the Y axis. The blue face passes through the field of vision, casting the illusory light and shadow, like a river of stars pouring down. Then, the rotation spread to the edges of red and green, and the two chased and played in three-dimensional space. The red was like a flame leaping, and the green was like a vine stretched. Under the precise dispatch of the rotation matrix, the color boundary was blurred and reborn, as if the space itself was breathing.

The angle shifts subtly with each frame of time, and the cube turns into a dynamic monument - when the blue side disappears into the shadow, the yellow side blooms brilliantly; at the moment of red and green, a brief violet dream is born. This rotation is not a mechanical repetition, but a philosophical walk of color in four-dimensional time and space. Every rotation reshapes the narrative of light and solidifies the soul of Microsoft into an eternal movement poem.
